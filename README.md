#InverseProxy
This is a fork of [LittleProxy](https://github.com/adamfisk/LittleProxy) with a twist - you are free to invert upstream and downstream. Thus creating a reverse proxy instead of the default forward proxy that LittleProxy aims to be.


LittleProxy is a high performance HTTP proxy written in Java atop Trustin Lee's excellent [Netty](netty.io) event-based networking library. It's quite stable, performs well, and is easy to integrate into your projects.

All credit goes to the original developer of LittleProxy and to Thomas Vissers who first detailed how to use LittleProxy as a reverse proxy on the project's [Google Group forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/littleproxy/rpcy_3zPr2k).
